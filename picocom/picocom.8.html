</td></tr></table></center>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<center><table width="90%"><tr><td>
  <p>
    As its name suggests, <b>picocom</b> is a minimal dumb-terminal
    emulation program. It is, in principle, very much like
    <a href=""><b>minicom</b>(1)</a>, only it's "pico" instead of
    "mini"! It was designed to serve as a simple, manual, modem
    configuration, testing, and debugging tool. It has also served
    (quite well) as a low-tech "terminal-window" to allow operator
    intervention in PPP connection scripts (something like the
    ms-windows "open terminal window before / after dialing" feature).
    It could also prove useful in many other similar tasks.
  </p>
  <p>
    When <b>picocom</b> starts it opens the terminal (serial device)
    given as its non-option argument. Unless the <i>--noinit</i>
    option is given, it configures the device to the settings
    specified by the option-arguments (or to some default settings),
    and sets it to "raw" mode. If <i>--noinit</i> is given, the
    initialization and configuration is skipped; the device is just
    opened. Following this, <b>picocom</b> sets the standard-input and
    standard-output to raw mode. Having done so, it goes in a loop
    where it listens for input from stdin, or from the serial port.
    Input from the serial port is copied to the standard output while
    input from the standard input is copied to the serial port. <b>picocom</b>
    also scans its input stream for a user-specified control
    character, called the "escape character" (being by default "C-a").
    If the escape character is seen, then instead of sending it to the
    serial-device, the program enters "command mode" and waits for the
    next character (which is called the "function character").
    Depending on the value of the function character, <b>picocom</b>
    performs one of the operations described in the "Commands" section
    below.
  </p>
</td></tr></table></center>

<h2>COMMANDS</h2>
<center><table width="90%"><tr><td>
  <p>
    Commands are given to <b>picocom</b> by first keying the "espace
    character" which by default is "C-a" (see "Options" below on how
    to change it), and then keying one for the function (command)
    characters shown here.
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>
      [escape character]
    </b></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Send the escape character to the serial port and return to
        "transparent" mode. This means that if the escape character
        ("C-a", by default) is typed twice, the program sends the
        escape character to the serial port, and remains in
        transparent mode. This is a new behavior implemented in v1.4.
        Previously picocom used to ignore the escape-character when it
        was entered as a function character.

    <dd>
      <p>
        Exit the program: if the "--noreset" option was not given then
        the serial port is reset to its original settings before
        exiting; if it was given the serial port is not reset.
      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>
      C-q

    <dd>
      <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    assuming of-course that "C-a" is the escape character.

<h2>SENDING AND RECEIVING FILES</h2>
<center><table width="90%"><tr><td>
  <p>
    <b>picocom</b> can send and receive files over the serial port
    using external programs that implement the respective protocols.
    In Linux typical programs for this purpose are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href=""><b>rx</b>(1)</a> - receive using the X-MODEM
        protocol
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href=""><b>rb</b>(1)</a> - receive using the Y-MODEM
        protocol
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href=""><b>rz</b>(1)</a> - receive using the Z-MODEM
        protocol
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href=""><b>sx</b>(1)</a> - send using the X-MODEM protocol
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href=""><b>sb</b>(1)</a> - send using the Y-MODEM protocol
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href=""><b>sz</b>(1)</a> - send using the Z-MODEM protocol
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <a href=""><b>ascii-xfr</b>(1)</a> - receive or transmit ASCII
        files
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The name of, and the command-line options to, the program to be
    used for transmitting files are given by the "--send-cmd" option.
    Similarly the program to receive files, and its argumets, are
    given by the "--receive-cmd" option. For example, in order to
    start a <b>picocom</b> session that uses "sz" to transmit files,
    and "rz" to receive, you have to say something like this:
  </p>
  <p>
    picocom --send-cmd "sz -vv" --receive-cmd "rz -vv"
  </p>
  <p>
    During the picocom session, if you key the "send" or "receive"
    commands (e.g. by pressing C-a, C-s, or C-a, C-r) you will be
    prompted for a filename. At this prompt you can enter one or more
    file-names, and any additional arguments to the transmission or
    reception program. After that, picocom will start the the external
    program as specified by the "--send-cmd", or "--receive-cmd"
    option, and with any filenames and additional arguments you may
    have supplied. The standard input and output of the external
    program will be connected to the serial port. The standard error
    of the external program will be connected to the terminal
    which---while the program is running---will revert to canonical
    mode. Pressing 'C-c' while the external program is running will
    prematurely terminate it, and return control to <b>picocom</b>.
    Pressing 'C-c' at any other time, has no special effect; the
    character is normally passed to the serial port.
  </p>
</td></tr></table></center>

<h2>INPUT, OUTPUT, AND ECHO MAPPING</h2>
<center><table width="90%"><tr><td>
  <p>
    Using the "--imap", "--omap", and "--emap" options you can make
    <b>picocom</b> map (tranlate, replace) certain special characters
    after being read from the serial port (with <i>--imap</i>), before
    being written to the serial port (with <i>--omap</i>), and before
    being locally echoed to the terminal (standard output) if local
    echo is enabled (with <i>--emap</i>). These mapping options take,
    each, a single argument which is a comma-separated list of one or
    more of the following identifiers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      crlf: map CR to LF
    </li>
    <li>
      crcrlf: map CR to CR + LF
    </li>
    <li>
      igncr: ignore CR
    </li>
    <li>
      lfcr: map LF to CR
    </li>
    <li>
      lfcrlf: map LF to CR + LF
    </li>
    <li>
      ignlf: ignore LF
    </li>
    <li>
      bsdel: map BS --> DEL
    </li>
    <li>
      delbs: map DEL --> BS
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For example the command:
  </p>
  <p>
    picocom --omap crlf,delbs --imap inglf,bsdel --emap crcrlf ...
  </p>
  <p>
    will: Replace every CR (carriage return, 0x0d) caracter with LF
    (line feed, 0x0a) and every DEL (delete, 0x7f) character with BS
    (backspace, 0x08) before writing it to the serial port. Ignore
    (not write to the terminal) every LF character read from the
    serial port and replace every BS character read from the serial
    port with DEL. Replace every CR character with CR and LF when
    echoing to the terminal (if local-echo is enabled).

        If given, <b>picocom</b> will not initialize, reset, or
        otherwise meddle with the serial port at start-up. It will
        just open it. This is useful, for example, for connecting <b>picocom</b>
        to already-connected modems, or already configured ports
        without terminating the connection, or altering the settings.
        If required serial port parameters can then be adjusted at

        This is useful, for example, for leaving modems connected when
        exiting <b>picocom</b>. Regardless whether the "--noreset"
        option is given the user can exit <b>picocom</b> using the
        "Quit" command (instead of "Exit"), which never resets the
        serial port. If "--noreset" is given then "Quit" and "Exit"

    <dd>
      <p>
        If given, <b>picocom</b> will *not* attempt to lock the serial

        UUCP-style lock-file (e.g. "/var/lock/LCK..ttyS0") before
        opening the port. Failing to do so, results in the program
        exiting after emitting an error-message. It is possible that
